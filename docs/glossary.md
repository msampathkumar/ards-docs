# Glossary

Terms used across the Agentic Resource Discovery (ARD) specification and this site.

### Agentic resource

Any external capability an AI client can call on to perform a task: an agent, MCP server, Skill, API, workflow, AI Catalog entry, or similar. The umbrella term ARD is built around.

### Agent Finder

A *product*: one discovery service built on ARD — [github.com/agentfinder](https://github.com/agentfinder). It is not the specification itself; many discovery services, named or not, can implement ARD.

### AI Catalog

The base, artifact-agnostic manifest standard ARD builds on. A publisher hosts an `ai-catalog.json` file describing its agentic resources. See the [AI Catalog Standard](ai_catalog_spec.md).

### AI client

An orchestrator, agent, or harness — a chatbot, IDE assistant, or automation — that discovers agentic resources through ARD and invokes the ones it selects over their native mechanisms. Also just *client*.

### ARD (Agentic Resource Discovery)

The open protocol defined by this specification: how agentic resources describe themselves, how clients ask for them, and how discovery services answer — all *before* invocation.

### Attestation

A verifiable claim attached to a catalog entry's `trustManifest` (e.g. SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR) that a registry or client can fetch and check.

### Capability manifest

Another name for the `ai-catalog.json` file a publisher hosts to advertise its agentic resources.

### Catalog entry

A single agentic resource description within a manifest: its identifier, type, location (`url` or inline `data`), and optional metadata.

### Discovery service

A service that indexes agentic resources and answers search queries (`POST /search`). The specification's formal term is **Agent Registry** (or **registry**); this site uses "discovery service" and "registry" interchangeably. **Agent Finder** is one such product.

### Federation

How discovery services draw on each other. A search's `federation` parameter is `auto` (the service merges upstream results), `referrals` (it returns other services for the client to query itself), or `none`.

### MCP, A2A, and Skills

Examples of the execution mechanisms and resource types ARD wraps: Model Context Protocol servers, Agent-to-Agent agent cards, and Skills. ARD discovers them; each is invoked over its own mechanism.

### Media type

The IANA media type in a catalog entry's `type` field, identifying what an artifact is — e.g. `application/mcp-server+json`, `application/a2a-agent-card+json`, `application/ai-skill`. ARD acts as an envelope over these.

### Publisher

Whoever hosts an `ai-catalog.json` describing one or more agentic resources, typically at `https://<domain>/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`.

### Referral

An entry in a search response pointing to another discovery service the client may query itself (used with `federation: "referrals"`).

### Registry / Agent Registry

The specification's term for a discovery service that exposes the standard REST search interface. See [Discovery service](#discovery-service).

### Relevance score

The `score` (0–100) on a search result: a semantic relevance ranking from the discovery service. It is **not** a trust, compliance, or safety rating.

### Representative queries

Sample natural-language queries (`representativeQueries`, 2–5 per entry) that registries use to build semantic search ranking.

### Trust manifest

Optional verifiable identity and trust metadata on a catalog entry (`trustManifest`): a cryptographic `identity` (e.g. `did:web`, SPIFFE), `attestations`, `provenance`, and a detached signature. ARD communicates these signals; it does not itself confer trust.

### URN identifier

A catalog entry's domain-anchored logical identifier, `urn:ai:<publisher>:<namespace>:<agent-name>`, where `<publisher>` is a verifiable domain. It roots identity in DNS and stays stable as infrastructure changes.

### Well-known URI

The conventional manifest location, `https://<domain>/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`, where discovery services look for a publisher's catalog.
